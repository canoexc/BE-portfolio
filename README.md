### Intro: 
For those who study or work in digital media field, when applying for schools or jobs, they need to sort their portfolio and submit them. Since digital media is a cross-disciplinary field, portfolios usually contain many types of work such as pictures, articles, projects, and executable programs. When users employ traditional methods to manage their portfolio website, their websites donâ€™t have back-end server, instead they need to insert the static resources into the front-end codes or resources folders, which acquires users having coding knowledge.

### Tech: 
Therefore, in order to attract more users and reduce the difficulty of building portfolio website. A system offering CRUD(create, read, update, delete) contents, and user communication as well as portfolio presenting is what exactly needed. This graduation design employs MVVM model, B/S architecture. The technical stack of front-end includes Vue framework, Element components library and of back end includes SpringBoot framework, and MyBatis-Plus etc. The MySQL database is built on Tecentyun ECS and all the files are saved in Aliyun OSS. The aim of the design is to build a website offering profile module, community module, which can help users CRUD their resources, design module, check out others resources, and communicate with other users.
